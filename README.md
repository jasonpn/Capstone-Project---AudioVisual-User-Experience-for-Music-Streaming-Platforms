Audiovisual User Experience for Music Streaming Platforms
In progress project for Rochester Institute of Technology Master's Program


Project Description Abstract:

The current music industry has already made its massive move to online streaming
platforms which now dominate the online audio space. Within its move, the online streaming
field now also encapsulates other content such as talk shows and music videos, showing the
industry’s interest and evolution to investing into a more audio-visual space. This Capstone
Project will address the current lack of visual content on popular streaming platforms coupling
its audio content that will help push them closer to the audiovisual space that the online music
streaming industry is moving towards in the future. The completion of the project will involve
my working to research, collect data, and develop a product from January to April 2025. This
project will result in a working software product that will demonstrate the technology that could
be used to provide more visual content to music streaming platforms, along with a project report
and documentation that will give insight into the project development as well as data on whether
the product will enhance the overall user experience of popular streaming platforms. The project
aims to enhance the user’s enjoyment of music through popular streaming platforms and be a
contribution in the evolution of the online music industry.
